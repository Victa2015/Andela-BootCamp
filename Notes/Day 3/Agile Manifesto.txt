uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it," 
they have come to value Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools, 
Working software over Comprehensive documentation, Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation, 
and Responding to change over Following a plan



The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles:[15]

Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Working software is the principal measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
